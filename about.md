I am a postdoc at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) focusing on neutron imaging of lithium batteries. I have works published in Electrochemica Acta, Nanoscale and the Journal of Power Sources.  My dissertation work focused on vanadium redox flow batteries while my bachelors degree was in mechanical engineering.

My research interests include: electrochemistry, mass transfer in porous media, lattice Boltzmann method, high performance computing, GPU computing, and neural networks.

As hobbies, I play music guitar and banjo primarily, but also bass/double bass, mandolin and drums. I am also a vim enthusiast and a fan of posix computing.

*Thank You for reading!*
